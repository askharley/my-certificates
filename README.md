 # Experience
 
 #### Haefele Software (November 2018 - Present) - Intermediate Software Developer
 
As I moved into an intermediate position, I moved into a new project - Axsess Today. Axsess Today is an Australian based FinTech company with development teams all over the world. I moved onto a team which taught me a lot about the agile process and being a cog in the machine. This project introduced me to CQRS, event sourcing and domain driven design.

I have further worked on multiple projects this year ranging from a logistics solution for Hellmann, a location based messaging application for an internal project and a portal to optomize certain business operations of Spur Corporation.

I've grown my skills to extend to Flutter, React and more C# CQRS based back-ends.
 
 #### Haefele Software (October 2017 - October 2018) - Junior Software Developer
 
I joined Haefele Software as Junior Software Developer in October of 2017. My project was OnSiteIMS which is a digital solution to the issues that face modern construction. OnSiteIMS allows for all of the parties involved in the construction of a building to communicate and share information effectively and categorically. I've fully redesigned and developed the new OnSiteIMS mobile application using the Ionic 3 framework.

My desire to learn as lead me to grow my skills in other departments and has given me the opportunity to be the business analyst, quality analyst and scrum master for the project.
 
 #### Where & When (March 2018 - Present) - Co-Founder / Tech Lead
 
In March of 2018, I helped found a startup called Where & When which aims to streamline and improve the process of artists and venues to host events while allowing users to follow artists or venues that they enjoy. The application has features such as live data, maps, earning loyalty points, receiving notifications when events are created etc. I have solely designed and developed the mobile application and used technologies like Flutter and Firebase.
 
 #### Full Facing (August 2016 - August 2017) - Software Developer
 
 I joined Full Facing as an intern for 8 months where I had to do some light backend work on a project called iFings which worked with a variety of sensors to provide information to clients such as temperature, humidity etc.

After my internship, I became a full-time developer where I worked on the larger projects such as GateKeeper Ticketing and Lessondesk. I was one of the main backend developers on these projects which came with a lot of responsibility.

I also developed a course to help train new interns. This course involved me managing and training the interns to help speedup their training and prepare them for what development is actually like.

I worked with Scala, RabbitMQ, MongoDB and the Google Cloud Platform.
