# About

My summary is that I'm ambitious, driven and hard working.

I've got a higher certificate and a BSc degree (not that a qualifications mean that I know how to code). I've been working since I was 20.

My goal is to learn as much as possible each day and share that with as many people as possible. I run a personal blog where I explain cool stuff, I conduct workshops to teach other developers about certain topics and I'm a mentor for CodeYourFuture which aims to give disadvantaged individuals an opportunity by having volunteers teach them an 8 month coding course.

I learn fast and grow fast so be prepared for that. Coding is my passion first, job second so be ready for me to be the one challenging how we can improve and make stuff better.

The TL;DR for my experience that I've worked in functional languages (like Scala), object orientated languages (like C#) and pretty much every frontend framework you can think of (React, Flutter, Angular, Ionic, Razor etc.).

I do love my frontend work but I'm (in my opinion) truly fullstack. I can write the backend code (pretty rock solidly I might add), host everything in cloud platforms and have a killer frontend for the user.

 # Experience
 
 #### Haefele Software (July 2020 - Present) - Senior Software Developer / Lead Frontend Developer
 
I've moved into a senior developer position along with taking on the responsibilities of a lead frontend developer.

My wide variety of experience with various frontend frameworks coupled with my ability to very rapidly gain a deep understanding of each framework has allowed me to make a real impact on the projects that I'm on. More recently, my focus has moved into sharing as much of this knowledge as possible so that other developers aren't tasked with paying the same school fees I've had to pay.

My desire to share knowledge and help others has tied in well with the timing with Haefele Software as a company believing that they need a frontend focused lead. My responsibilities are going to start with continuing to improve company-wide knowledge around frontend, helping determine a more frontend focused career path for other developers who are more frontend inclined as well as directly helping review and encourage other developers as they go forward on their journey.

My role dictates that I need to stay update with the ever-changing world of frontend software development. I'll need to make judgement calls with sometimes a little amount of information. I'll touch each project that has frontend work to help ensure the quality of code, build a foundation for other developers and answer any questions that teams may have.
 
#### Haefele Software (November 2018 - June 2020) - Intermediate Software Developer
 
As I moved into an intermediate position, I moved into a new project - Axsess Today. Axsess Today is an Australian based FinTech company with development teams all over the world. I moved onto a team which taught me a lot about the agile process and being a cog in the machine. This project introduced me to CQRS, event sourcing and domain driven design.

I have further worked on multiple projects this year ranging from a logistics solution for Hellmann, a location based messaging application for an internal project, a portal to optomize certain business operations of Spur Corporation as well as a large middleware project to help consolidate data.

My skills have extended to Azure App Services, Azure Function Apps, Azure Service Bus, Azure Storage, Azure Search services as well as many other Azure features.

On top of that, I've taken it upon my self to run workshops and sessions with other developers where I explain more complex frontend (React, Flutter etc) paradigms so that they can write better code on their projects. Doing this has benefitted other developers and their teams but has also allowed me to gain a deep understanding for a large variety of frontend technologies.

My frontend knowledge coupled with my ability to write C# backend code (in MVC, CQRS etc) and make use of cloud platforms like Azure truly makes me full stack and allows me to understand a solution from the ground up.
 
 #### Haefele Software (October 2017 - October 2018) - Junior Software Developer
 
I joined Haefele Software as Junior Software Developer in October of 2017. My project was OnSiteIMS which is a digital solution to the issues that face modern construction. OnSiteIMS allows for all of the parties involved in the construction of a building to communicate and share information effectively and categorically. I've fully redesigned and developed the new OnSiteIMS mobile application using the Ionic 3 framework.

My desire to learn lead me to grow my skills in other departments which gave me the opportunity to be the business analyst, quality analyst and scrum master for the project.
 
 #### Where & When (March 2018 - Present) - Co-Founder / Tech Lead
 
In March of 2018, I helped found a startup called Where & When which aims to streamline and improve the process of artists and venues to host events while allowing users to follow artists or venues that they enjoy. The application has features such as live data, maps, earning loyalty points, receiving notifications when events are created etc. I have solely designed and developed the mobile application and used technologies like Flutter and Firebase.
 
 #### Full Facing (August 2016 - August 2017) - Software Developer
 
 I joined Full Facing as an intern for 8 months where I had to do some light backend work on a project called iFings which worked with a variety of sensors to provide information to clients such as temperature, humidity etc.

After my internship, I became a full-time developer where I worked on the larger projects such as GateKeeper Ticketing and Lessondesk. I was one of the main backend developers on these projects which came with a lot of responsibility.

I also developed a course to help train new interns. This course involved me managing and training the interns to help speedup their training and prepare them for what development is actually like.

I worked with Scala, RabbitMQ, MongoDB and the Google Cloud Platform.

# Other

#### CodeYourFuture (April 2020 - Present) - Software Developer

Volunteer mentor and teacher as a part of the Cape Town division of CodeYourFuture. My role is to share my knowledge about code, finding a job, the industry and software in general with the students.

My time will be spent on consolidating the course material, preparing lessons, teaching modules, having drop in sessions with students, answering questions and going through exercises and code. Meetings with students can take place online during the week but there will be an in person session on Saturdays to thoroughly go through lessons, material and exercises.

Students are composed of mostly disadvantaged individuals who are wanting to learn software from ground zero. The course will take place over 8 months with the aim that after completion, students are capable and ready to find work as junior software developers.

# Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

# Soft Skills

- Natural leader (I tend to have something to say and so far people like what I've had to say)
- Teacher (I get the most fulfillment from teaching others)
- Dedicated (I put in the hours)
- Attentative (I'm a perfectionist to a fault)
- Team player (I'll make sure everyone on the team is able to do their job before I do mine because the team comes first)

# Hard Skills

- Logical and rational (at least I think so yet maybe everyone does)
- Good at breaking down problems (just like you'd break down components in React)
- Detail orientated (if my code isn't perfectly indented then I've messed up)
- Clean code enthuisiast (if you're not writing clean code then you're just giving everyone a harder time)
- Functional and objected-orientated approach (lessons from one can solve problems in the other)
- Most importantly: I actually write unit tests!
