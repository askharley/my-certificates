 # Experience
 
 #### Full Facing (August 2016 - August 2017) - Software Developer
 
 I joined Full Facing as an intern for 8 months where I had to do some light backend work on a project called iFings which worked with a variety of sensors to provide information to clients such as temperature, humidity etc.

After my internship, I became a full-time developer where I worked on the larger projects such as GateKeeper Ticketing and Lessondesk. I was one of the main backend developers on these projects which came with a lot of responsibility.

I also developed a course to help train new interns. This course involved me managing and training the interns to help speedup their training and prepare them for what development is actually like.

I worked with Scala, RabbitMQ, MongoDB and the Google Cloud Platform.
